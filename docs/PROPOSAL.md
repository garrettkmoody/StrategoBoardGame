# CPTR 142 Project III: Stratego



## Problem Definition

The goal for this project is to create a replication of the board game Stratego
using c++. When the project is completed, it will allow the user to play a game
of Stratego against an AI opponent that uses random moves, or against a human
opponent. The basic rules of Stratego are to be followed by both the player(s)
and their possible AI opponents.

### Key Features

* Play against an AI or another person
* Basic Stratego gameplay of capturing pieces
* Game played on board made from ASCII characters

### Assumptions

The users of the game already understand how Stratego works (i.e. the game doesn't
lead a user step-by-step through how the game works)
When playing against another person, it is assumed that each user does not look at
the other's board when it is the other user's turn
